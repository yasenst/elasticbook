Introduciton to Programming,"Fundamental concepts of procedural programming and object-oriented programming. Includes data types, variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, arrays, files, linear data structures like stack, queue and linked list. Teaches in C, C++, C#, Java, Javascript.",Programming
Databases,"Introduction to the relational database model, manipulating data with an interactive query language SQL, database development and design",Databases
Data Structures and Algorithms,"Introduces common algorithms, algorithmic paradigms, and data structures. Teaches skills on algorithmization of problem, analysis and evaluation of algorithms and synthesis of programs based on such algorithms. Students get acquainted with the main groups of algorithms: number processing, sorting, searching, hashing, trees, graphs, recursion, list. The algorithmic solutions are reproduced and analyzed.",Algorithms
